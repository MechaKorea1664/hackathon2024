# Future EV Demand Impact on Energy and Emissions
Authors: Daniel Huynh, Duy Lam, Yagna Patel, and Kevin Yu

## Problem
This project analyzes how the transition from Gasoline Vehicles to Electric Vehicles (EVs) affects carbon emissions across the United States. By projecting future EV adoption rates and their corresponding energy demands, we identify optimal solutions to implement renewable energy infrastructure to support a carbon neutral world.

## Statement
This information can be used to develop and implement Renewable Energy policies that encourage a carbon neutral world. Governments can use this model to plan their budgets and see where more investments into renewable energy may be needed to meet challenges created from increasing EV demand.

## Project Impact

Policy Development
- Support creation of effective renewable energy policies
- Identify regions requiring immediate infrastructure investment

Resource Allocation
- Help governments optimize budget allocation for renewable and EV infrastructure
- Prioritize high-impact areas for renewable energy development
- Plan strategic grid and EV charging upgrades based on projected EV demand

Environmental Planning
- Track progress toward carbon neutrality goals
- Identify regions where emissions may increase without intervention
