# Future EV Demand Impact on Energy and Emissions
Authors: Daniel Huynh, Duy Lam, Yagna Patel, and Kevin Yu

## Problem
This project analyzes how the transition from Gasoline Vehicles to Electric Vehicles (EVs) affects carbon emissions across the United States. By projecting future EV adoption rates and their corresponding energy demands, we identify optimal solutions to implement renewable energy infrastructure to support a carbon neutral world.

## Statement
This information can be used to develop and implement green energy policies that encourage a net zero carbon emissions world. 
Governments can use this model to plan their budgets and see where more investments into green energy may be needed to meet challenges created from EV demand
