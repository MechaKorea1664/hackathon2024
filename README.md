# Future EV Demand Impact on Energy and Emissions
Authors: Daniel Huynh, Duy Lam, Yagna Patel, and Kevin Yu

## Problem
We are addressing the problem of EV growth in the U.S. and it's potential demand on the power grid and emissions. Through this analysis, we can analyze areas that need more power infrastructure to support EVs and areas that should consider cleaner energy sources to meet future demand.

## Statement
This information can be used to develop and implement green energy policies that encourage a net zero carbon emissions world. 
Governments can use this model to plan their budgets and see where more investments into green energy may be needed to meet challenges created from EV demand
